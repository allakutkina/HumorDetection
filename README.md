# HumorDetection
HAHA 2021 shared task.

An attempt to tackle the four humor detection tasks from shared task HAHA@IberLEF2021 (Chiruzzo et al., 2021). Resulting system employs a shared architecture for 4 subtasks. Only the output layer is altered. The presented architecture is based on LSTM with Word2Vec embeddings and extra hand-engineered feature input. Output layers are varied across 4 subtasks: binary output, regression, multi-class and multi-label output. Presented system is ranked 8 in post-evaluation phase of HAHA@IberLEF2021.
